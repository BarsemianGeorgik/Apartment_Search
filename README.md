# WebSearchAndLogIn

The main web site file is where the user can log in into his account or create a new account,
once that is resolved.
The user can proceed on to his apartment search.
The user can still do apartment searching even if he isnt logged in,
but in the results the addresss wont appear.
The adress appears only if the user is logged in.

The usernames and passwords are saved into the unser_info.txt file
And the apartmend information can be found inside the apartment_info.txt
